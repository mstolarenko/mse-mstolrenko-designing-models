## **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model

Using a class diagram to visualize the raw code provided from the POTS model, the model is split into four primary categories: soil, containers, water, and vegetables. In practice you need all four components in order to grow a plant. The growth of the vegetable is the ultimate end goal of this model code, trying to find a sweet balance between keeping the plant alive by watering it but also not killing the plant from overexposure to water. Different soils are able to retain different amounts of water, different types of water will provide the plant and soil with varying amounts of water, and each vegetable has different growth rates that excel in certain conditions more than others. A container is required, otherwise the system has no boundaries and the plant cannot realistically grow.

# Coding Framework for Modeling Port Unloading Backlogs

## [Framework #1](https://github.com/IDS6145-Fall2022/assignment-1-mse-mstolarenko/blob/main/code/1.4-Frameworks/assignment1-framework1.py)
-Framework #1 builds a skeleton code of some of the common types of heavy machinery located on the dry dock section of ports. These include the cranes and transportation vehicles and can be quantified based on how much cargo they transport as well as their location.


## [Framework #2](https://github.com/IDS6145-Fall2022/assignment-1-mse-mstolarenko/blob/main/code/1.4-Frameworks/assignment1-framework2.py)
-Framework #2 builds a skeleton code of some of the key staff members aboard cargo vessels as they travel from port to port, as well as what their roles are as the vessel enters and exits ports. This showcases that upper deck staff have to communicate with other networks around them while lower deck staff keep the ship in prime condition to avoid downtime.

## [Framework #3](https://github.com/IDS6145-Fall2022/assignment-1-mse-mstolarenko/blob/main/code/1.4-Frameworks/assignment1-framework3.py)
-Framework #3 builds a skeleton code of some of the key staff members stationed on the dry ports. These staff members are responsible for guiding ships in and ensuring that cargo is unloaded and loaded quickly to prevent downtime.

## [Framework #4](https://github.com/IDS6145-Fall2022/assignment-1-mse-mstolarenko/blob/main/code/1.4-Frameworks/assignment1-framework4.py)
-Framework #4 builds a skeleton code of some of the types of cargo loaded onto shipping vessels. These typically consist of dry good storage units and liquid storage units. It is important to differentiate each in code as they require different methods of securing on the vessel.

## [Framework #5](https://github.com/IDS6145-Fall2022/assignment-1-mse-mstolarenko/blob/main/code/1.4-Frameworks/assignment1-framework5.py)
-Framework #5 builds a skeleton code of the cargo stationed in the port as it waits for ships to arrive to transport them elsewhere. It is important to pay attention to these containers as they take up space for other containers so long as their ship does not arrive in time.
